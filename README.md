# ibf-topic-updater

## Synopsis

A plugin for [irc-bot-framework](https://github.com/jthomerson/irc-bot-framework) that can automatically update
a topic in a channel from some dynamic data source.

Good for combining with [irc-cron-messages](https://github.com/jthomerson/irc-cron-messages). The cron plugin can send
the update command to this plugin on a regular basis, causing your topic to be continually updated on a schedule.
